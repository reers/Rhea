/// - Note: The `StaticString` follows the format:
///  "prefix.rheaTimeName.priority.isRepeatable.isAsync"
///   - prefix: The namespace or module identifier.
///   - rheaTimeName: The specific timing or event name.
///   - priority: An integer indicating the execution priority.
///   - isRepeatable: A boolean flag ('true' or 'false') indicating if the function can be called multiple times.
///   - isAsync: A boolean flag ('true' or 'false') indicating if the function can be called asynchronously.
/// - Example: "rhea.load.5.true.false"
